## Springbot Coding challenge
* This is a Springbot coding challenge, the original link can be found here: https://github.com/springbot/whats-for-lunch

## What I completed
* Ability to add Restaurants to a database
* Ability to review and rate restaurants
* Ability to input the last time you visited the restaurant
* Upon visiting the root URL and signing up, you will be recommended a restaurant
* Upon going to the detailed view of the Restaurant, you will see a table of all reviews and the average rating for the restaurant

## What I want to accomplish if I have more time:
* Instead of the recommended restaurant being completely random, I'd like to put in some logic to recommend a restaurant that I haven't visited or been recommended to go to in a while and have a high average rating
* Getting the app live on Heroku
* Write tests
