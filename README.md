## Springbot Coding challenge
* This is a Springbot coding challenge, the original link can be found here: https://github.com/springbot/whats-for-lunch
* The application is live on Heroku and can be found here: https://sheltered-basin-91840.herokuapp.com/

## What I completed
* Ability to add Restaurants to a database
* Ability to review and rate restaurants
* Ability to input the last time you visited the restaurant
* Upon visiting the root URL, you will be recommended a restaurant based on the average rating and the last time it was recommended to you if you are logged in.
* Upon going to the show view of the Restaurant, you will see a table of all the reviews for that restaurant
* Average rating is calculated and updated every time a review is added to a restaurant

## What's next:
* Write tests
